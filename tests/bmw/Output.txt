With its bigger engine and sizable list of performance equipment, the X5 50i hunts prey of a sportier nature -- namely, Porsche's Cayenne S. Does this powerful Bimmer have what it takes to stand toe-to-toe with its great-driving rival from Stuttgart? Adaptive dampers are standard issue on the 50i, but my tester's $3,650 Dynamic Handling Package raises the handling stakes further with rear-wheel steering, a torque-vectoring rear differential, active antiroll bars and upgraded brakes. It's easier to get acclimated to the location of hard buttons and far less distracting than sifting through numerous menus just to do things like change vents settings or switch between preset radio stations.
